I am full stack Angular + .NET developer and problem solving is my favorite. I love hard problem because I can learn a lot of knowledge from it.

Beside working, I usually learning about investing and financing in my free time. Hanging out with friend and breathing fresh air is what I usually do in the weekend after a hard working week.

Working in a group is hard, but I love something challenging. Having multiple conversation to have an unified opinion is a feeling when I reach a goal of my daily basic.

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:
- Highly skilled in designing, testing, and developing software
- Thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Knowledgeable of back-end development best practices
- Hands-on software troubleshooting experience
- Proven track record of proper documentation for future maintenance and upgrades

I have built several projects (Bug Tracker, Ecommerce Online Market, and personal Blog) using ASP .NET MVC C# as Back-end, Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, BootStrap, and Ajax as Front-end, I using Database like PostgresSQL, and MicrosoftSQL server. I also work on WebAPI, Angular, and Stripe.

You can have a look at all of my projects in my online portfolio. This is the link to my online portfolio:
